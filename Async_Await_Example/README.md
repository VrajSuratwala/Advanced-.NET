## This Program breaks down the core concepts of:

- ✅ **Synchronous Execution** – One task at a time, orderly, blocking.
- 🔁 **Asynchronous Execution** – Multiple tasks can be started independently, promoting non-blocking parallelism.

You'll witness how tasks like "Washing Clothes", "Cleaning", and "Cooking" behave under both synchronous and asynchronous executions, using delays (`Task.Delay`) to simulate real-world processing times.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- The difference between sync and async methods in .NET.
- How to use `async` and `await` effectively.
- Simulating real-world scenarios using `Task`, `Task<T>`, and `Task.Delay`.
- How async programming reduces execution time when tasks can run in parallel.
